# Robust Encryption and Decryption Techniques for Multimedia Using AES and Triple DES

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing robust encryption and decryption techniques specifically for multimedia files, utilizing AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard). It provides secure methods to protect sensitive multimedia content from unauthorized access and ensures confidentiality and integrity during transmission or storage.

## Key Features:
- **AES Encryption**: Implements the AES algorithm for efficient and secure encryption of multimedia data.
- **Triple DES Encryption**: Adds an extra layer of security with Triple DES encryption, enhancing data protection.
- **Multimedia Support**: Designed to handle various multimedia file formats, ensuring compatibility with images, audio, and video.
- **Decryption**: Allows for the retrieval of original multimedia content using the decryption keys.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for minimal processing time, providing a balance between security and performance.

## Technologies Used:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Encryption Algorithms**: AES, Triple DES
- **Libraries**: `pycryptodome` (for encryption), OpenCV (for multimedia processing), `PIL` (for image processing), `moviepy` (for video/audio processing)
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, GitHub

## Key Points:
1. **Enhanced Security**: Utilized AES and Triple DES to provide multiple levels of encryption, ensuring maximum protection for multimedia content.
2. **Multimedia Compatibility**: Integrated image, audio, and video support for encryption and decryption, addressing the diverse nature of multimedia files.
3. **Optimized Performance**: Ensured fast encryption/decryption cycles, making the solution viable for real-world applications, without compromising security.
